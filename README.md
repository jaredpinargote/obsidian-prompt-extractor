# Obsidian Prompt Extractor

## Introduction

I wanted ChatGPT to understand context from my Obsidian vault. I kept copying and pasting my content. That was annoying so I looked into RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), but that was much more complicated that what I really needed.

So I create a tool to help make extracting relevant context for ChatGPT much faster.
Your introduction has a conversational and relatable tone, highlighting a personal problem and the journey to solve it. It's straightforward, sharing the initial challenge and the motivation behind creating the tool. In contrast, my draft focused more on appealing to a broader audience and included more emotive and evocative language.
